### Description ###

This repository stores the code of our DUT fourth semester's tutored project.
We've chosen the subject "Campground management software : Les Flots Blancs".
It consists in creating a software allowing the camping owner to be more efficient in managing

(e.g. client management, issues management, locations management,etc.).
